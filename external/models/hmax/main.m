%%      FUNCTION: some code to show how calcCSSITC2new.m is called and how
%%                variables are set up (together with init_HMAX.m)
%%		  
%%   DESCRIPTION: this code demonstrates how to initialize the
%%                parameters and call calcCSSITC2new for an
%%                image. To run this from a Matlab prompt, simply
%%                type '>>main'. The output is a vector of C2
%%                responses in the variable 'c2Resp'.
%%                Look at the file init_HMAX.m to see how to set
%%                the parameters.

% load the image
fid=fopen('testImage.gray','r');
stim=reshape(fread(fid,'uchar'),128,128)'; % 8 bit grays
fclose(fid);

% ...and now calculate the C2 response by calling calcCSSITC2new:
c2Resp=calcCSSITC2new(stim,0)';

disp('Done. The C2 response is in the variable c2Resp.');
