This SDK consists of the following components:

ClientSDK - the standard Matlab client SDK. See ClientSDK\Readme.doc.

PlexDoSDK - the PlexDO digital output SDK for Matlab. See PlexDoSDK\PlexDOReadme.rtf.
  	(Note that this document is focused on C/C++ development, but all of the concepts and
         function names are the same. There is a section at the end describing usage in Matlab.)

SoftServer - SoftServer.exe is a testing program that can emulate data coming from a MAP on systems 
	where a MAP is not installed. This is useful for testing and debugging online programs.
        See SoftServer\SoftServerUserGuide.doc. (Again, this document is focused on usage with
	the C/C++ SDK, but all concepts and instructions also apply to usage with Matlab online scripts.)
